RECOMMENDED MOTORCYCLES

-- QUIZ 


ONE REVIEW PER USER PER MOTORCYCLE


1:
WHEN I ADD A SEARCH TERM IN THE MOTORCYCLE EXPLORE PAGE, THE RESULT I GET DOESNT INCLUDE THE OTHER FILTERS, BUT THE URL KEEPS ALL THE FILTERS INSIDE.
e.g. http://localhost:3000/motorcycles?horsePowerMin=65&displacementMax=750&search=honda;\

2:
ONE REVIEW PER USER AND MOTORCYCLE. IF USER ALREADY REVIEWED ONE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO EDIT HIS REVIEW, BUT NOT CREATE ANOTHER ONE!

3:
Paginate user reviews, if a moto has 500 reviews I don't want to show a huge list. (LATER...)

4:
export default withAuth(RequestsPage, { requiredRole: "ADMIN" }); //TODO WHEN REFRESH BREAKS!!!

5:
change password user functionality (READY IN BACKEND)
